## Machine Learning Techniques
Using TensorFlow to generate short sequences of music with a [Restricted Boltzmann Machine](http://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html).
Do you want to go deep?, see the original technical idea: [How to build an RBM neural network in tensorflow](http://danshiebler.com/2016-08-10-musical-tensorflow-part-one-the-rbm/).



## Getting Started

1. Install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
2. Install [Anaconda and dependencies](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
3. Create your virtual environment and install dependencies:

```

# Create virtualenv
virtualenv venv

# Activate venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the missing dependencies
pip install [library]

# To train the model and create music
python fire.py

# Depends of the technical capabilities of your computer, it can take from 5 to 10 minutes. 

```

## Contribute
We need your help feeding and training our current model. If you have reggeaton samples feel free to contribute.
